Syntax:
========

sed <options>  /pattern/action  file

p	Prints the line
d	Deletes the line
s/pattern1/pattern2/	Substitutes the first occurrence of pattern1 with pattern2.



 sed -e 'd' /etc/passwd

sed '1d' 

sed '1, 5d' 


'4,10d'	Lines starting from 4th till 10th are deleted
'10,4d'	Only 10th line is deleted, because sed does not work in reverse direction.
'4,+5d'	This will match line 4 in the file, delete that line, continue to delete the next five lines, and then cease its deletion and print the rest
'2,5!d'	This will deleted everything except starting from 2nd till 5th line.
'1~3d'	This deletes the first line, steps over the next three lines, and then deletes the fourth line. Sed continues applying this pattern until the end of the file.
'2~2d'	This tells sed to delete the second line, step over the next line, delete the next line, and repeat until the end of the file is reached.
'4,10p'	Lines starting from 4th till 10th are printed
'4,d'	This would generate syntax error.
',10d'	This would also generate syntax error.
